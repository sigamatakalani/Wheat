\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
%Purpose of this document
\subsection{Scope}
%What is the system? What can the system do? What do we want it to do? The vision. Benefits, Objectives etc.
\subsection{Users}
%Who are we catering to with this system?
\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
%Basically the vision and the background of the system
\subsection{Product Features}

\subsection{User types}
%Describe the possible system users and a brief description of what makes each category of user unique
% e.g. Students, Lecturers, Cleaners
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Operating Environment}
%This system will be running on a mobile device
%Explain requirements for mobile device, will it have to use Android? etc. Are there space requirements? Will it need to be able to access the internet? And so on...
\subsection{Design and Implementation Constraints}
%Things that will limit the system. Things to keep in mind when working. For example only having access to geolocations of wifi hotspots, etc.
\subsection{Security, Safety & Privacy Requirements}
%To be discussed, but these are requirements to ensure the safety, security and privacy of the users of the system as well as the sytem itself. e.g. an authentication mechanism, limiting amount of information sent etc.
\subsection{User Documentation}
%About the users
\subsection{Assumptions}
%Assumptions that are made that will affect the system. That is, if these assumptions are incorrect system design and implementation will be affected.
\section{Software Features}
\subsection{Feature X}
%Replace "Feature X" with feature name
\subsubsection{Feature Description}
%Describe the feature and give its priority level
%Possible priority levels are: CRITCAL, IMPORTANT, NICE TO HAVE
\subsubsection{Sequences of user actions & System Responses}
%Here we will need to include a sequence diagram
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
%Here we will need to include a use case diagram

\subsection{Feature Y}
%Replace "Feature Y" with feature name
\subsubsection{Feature Description}
%Describe the feature and give its priority level
%Possible priority levels are: CRITCAL, IMPORTANT, NICE TO HAVE
\subsubsection{Sequences of user actions & System Responses}
%Here we will need to include a sequence diagram
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
%Here we will need to include a use case diagram

%... And So On
\section{External Interface Requirements}
\subsection{User Interfaces}
%??? The interfaces with which the user will communicate with the system? e.g. Mobile app, Web interface etc.
\subsection{Hardware Interfaces}
%??? Does the system have various hardware components that need to communicate? 
\subsection{Software Interfaces}
%I think these are the service contracts of the software features.
%Service contracts include a diagram.
%Basically how each service/interface of the sytem works.... (I think I can explain this better)
\subsection{Communications Interfaces}
%How various parts of the system will communicate with each other

\section{Non-functional Requirements} 
%See architecture docs I sent you for a better idea here
\subsection{Performance Requirements}
\subsection{Safety and Security Requirements}
\subsection{Software Quality Attributes}
\subsection{Other?}

\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Glossary of terms}
\subsection{List of issues}
\subsection{Figures and diagrams}
